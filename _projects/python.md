Different small web intelligence projects in python.

<br />
**blog-post-clustering:** Programming exercise for creating a small REST-service with a blog post clustering algorithm in Python, with a React client.

<br />
**movie-recommendation-system:** Programming exercise for creating a small REST-service with a movie recommendation algorithm in Python, with a React client.

<br />
**search-engine:** Programming exercise for creating a small REST-service with a search engine for searching Wikipedia articles in Python, with a React client.

<br />
**wikipedia-clustering:** Programming exercise for creating a small REST-service that clusters wikipedia articles, as well as using an algoritm to determine the best set of words to separate articles into two branches concerning different subjects, written in Python with a React client.

<br />
**machine-learning:** Machine learning exercise. Classifying a spiral data set using a Linear and a Neural Network classifier using the Scikit-learn framework. Using matplotlib to plot the data and the result as a confust√≠on matrix. Classifying the MNIST hand written digits data set using Keras, using both a Linear and a Convolutional Neural Network classifier. Using matplotlib to plot the results over epochs trained.
