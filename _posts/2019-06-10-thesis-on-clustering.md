#### Abstract - What we talk about when we talk about winners - Using clustering of Twitter topics as a basis for election prediction

Social media has over the years partly become a platform to express opinions
and discuss current events. Within the field of Computer Science, Twitter has
been used both as the basis for political analysis - for example using
sentiment analysis to predict election results - and within the field of cluster
analysis, where the question of how to best design and use an algorithm to
extract topics from tweets has been studied. Tâ€‹he ClusTop algorithm is
specifically designed to cluster tweets based on topics. This paper aims to
explore whether it is possible to (a) use an implementation of the ClusTop
algorithm to identify topics connected to tweets about Trump and Clinton just
before the American 2016 election, and (b) distinguish between the topics
used in connection with a specific candidate in states where they won versus
states where they lost the election. The problem is approached through the
method of a controlled experiment where the data collected from Twitter is
divided into groups and run through the ClusTop algorithm. The topics are
then compared to draw tentative conclusions about their validity as a basis for
election prediction. The study finds that it is indeed possible to adapt the
ClusTop algorithm to use with tweets and geolocation to identify different
topics, thus confirming the usefulness of the algorithm. In addition to this, the
study confirms that manually examining the words used within the topics
makes it possible to see differences between them. The work thereby places
itself in the tradition of exploring how Twitter can be used for election
prediction by being one of the first studies to look at clustering as a way of
approaching the problem.
